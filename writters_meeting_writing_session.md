I have been looking all over the city for you.

I know. I saw your texts.

But I didn't want to see anybody then.

Is everything alright.

So I saw people on netflix instead.

Where are you right now.

Home. Where else?

Can you be here now.

On my way. Right away. Be there in 50 minutes.

No. Dont come then.

It's alright.

I want you now.

Don't want anybody after 50 mintues.

My uber driver is on the way. 10 minutes.

Then I will reach sooner.

Thought:: Thank you for calling a cab.. I didn't think you would.. Wish you were here already..

Why are you telling me this?

Why aren't you picking up.

I said I don't want to talk to anybody.

Please do not come to my place.

Cancel your uber.

But you *are* talking to me here.

I wonder why.

I should stop

Didn't mean that.
