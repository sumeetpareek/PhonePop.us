Phonepop is a new literary format to express stories that live in our phones.

You probably have read comicbook stories and loved their graphics, and thought bubbles, and speech bubbles. Or may be you loved stories in novels with their descriptive prose. Or may be plays, where characters keep talking back and forth.

Just like these different literary formats, we wish to bring to you phonepop stories! :)

Goals of our project are - (a) Convert this imaginary format to a real one (b) Publish the first two phonepop stories, both comedies, titled `Flirting With The Bad Boys` and `Counting On The Wrong Men`, and (c) Build phonepop.us platform where others can write stories in this format across genres like drama, tragedy, erotica, suspense, comedy, etc.
